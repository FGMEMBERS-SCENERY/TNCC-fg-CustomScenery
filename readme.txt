INTRODUCTION
============
Hato International Airport or Curaçao International Airport is the airport of Willemstad, Curaçao. It has services to the Caribbean region, South America, North America and Europe. Hato Airport is a fairly large facility, with the third longest commercial runway in the Caribbean region (after Rafael Hernández Airport and Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport).

A new terminal was officially opened in 2006 and it accommodates a maximum of 1.6 million passengers per year.


INSTALLATION
============
You need to have already installed the scenary "w070n10".

1.- Replace all files contained on "Objects" to your "data/Scenery/Objects" folder.
2.- Copy "Airport-TNCC" folder to "data/Models".

NOTE: If FPS is too serious affected by quantity of models contained, you can edit the "1825160.stg" on "Objects" folder, and delete additional objects and elements that aren't entirely necesary to enjoy the scenary, which are clearly separated and labeled to better identify them.
